I do not export this function. The idea is that you use ```mpglu```
and do not touch either the constructor or the solver directly.

Use a multi-precision factorization to solve a linear system with
plain vanilla iterative refinement.

This version is analogous to ```A\\b``` and combines the factorization
and the solve. You start with MPA=MPArray(A) and then pass MPA
to mpgeslir and combine the factorization and the solve. 

You can also get the multiprecision factorization directly with
```
MPF=mplu(A)
```
and then pass ```MPF``` to mpgeslir.

I use this to get some timing results and it's also convenient
if you want to do factor and solve in one statement. 

You can also get this with ```x = MPA\\b```.

If you set the kwarg ```reporting``` to true you can get the IR
residual history. The output of 
```
x = MPA\\b
```
or
```
x=MPF\\b
```
is the solition. The output of 
```
mout = \\(MPA,b; reporting=true)
```
or
```
mout = \\(MPF,b; reporting=true)
```
is a structure. ```mpout.sol``` is the solution. ```mpout.rhist```
is the residual history. ```mpout.dhist``` is the history of the
norms of the corrections.  mpout also contains the datatypes TW for
high precision and TF for low precision.

You may not get exactly the same results for this example on
different hardware, BLAS, versions of Julia or this package. 
I am still playing with the termination criteria and the iteration
count could grow or shrink as I do that.

MPFact is a union of all the MultiPrecision factorizations in the package. 
The triangular solver will dispatch on the various types depending on
how the interprecision transfers get done.
